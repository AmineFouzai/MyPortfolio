I implemented data normalization techniques to reduce redundancy and ensure data integrity while establishing and maintaining relationships between various data entities such as customers, orders, and menu items to support diverse application functionalities.

In the backend development phase, I created scalable and performant RESTful APIs to handle customer orders, manage inventory, and process payments. Using a diverse set of programming languages and frameworks, I built robust backend services tailored to each task. I seamlessly integrated third-party services like payment gateways and delivery tracking systems to enhance functionality and improve the user experience. Additionally, I developed services utilizing different networking styles, including REST, GraphQL, and gRPC, ensuring flexible and efficient data exchange. My commitment to pixel-perfect integration ensured that the backend services seamlessly aligned with frontend designs, providing a consistent and visually appealing user interface. Through these efforts, I contributed significantly to the development of a reliable, efficient, and user-friendly fast food application that meets the needs of both the business and its customers.`,
